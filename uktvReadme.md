Thank you for allowing me to take this assessment.

With more time to focus on this I would have liked to separate the code located in App.tsx into smaller components.
I've already made a start with the use of the components folder.
A loading state to provide the user with some feedback on the coming data would have been added.
Sorting the results only works for the Films results, this would have been expanded to work with all results.
Hardcoded strings would have been moved to a separate folder/file as I've done with the .env file.

Any and all feedback is welcome as I'm still in the process of learning Typescript so this was a great experience for me.
